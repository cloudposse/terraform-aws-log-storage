# terraform-aws-s3-log-storage [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-log-storage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-log-storage)

This module creates an S3 bucket suitable for receiving logs from other `AWS` services such as `S3`, `CloudFront`, and `CloudTrails`.

It implements a configurable log retention policy, which allows you to efficiently manage logs across different storage classes (_e.g._ `Glacier`) and ultimately expire the data altogether.

It enables server-side default encryption.

## Usage

```hcl
module "log_storage" {
  source                   = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-log-storage.git?ref=master"
  name                     = "${var.name}"
  stage                    = "${var.stage}"
  namespace                = "${var.namespace}"
  acl                      = "${var.acl}"
  prefix                   = "${var.prefix}"
  standard_transition_days = "${var.standard_transition_days}"
  glacier_transition_days  = "${var.glacier_transition_days}"
  expiration_days          = "${var.expiration_days}"
}
```
